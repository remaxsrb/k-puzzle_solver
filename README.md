## K-Puzzle solver

K-Puzzle solver implemented in python using BFS, Best First Search and A* search algorithms. <br>
Heuristics used are Hamming and Manhattan. <br>
You can clone this repository, create a new project and after installing dependencies found in requirements.txt run it in terminal with command:
* __python3 ./main k_value image_name.png algorithm heuristic__

Note that for Best First Search you have to type with no spaces and for A* you should type in AStar

If you do not know how to install dependencies from requirements.txt here is the command you should use:
* __pip install -r requirements.txt__

__I've only implemented search algorithms and heuristics, rest of the code was given to me as a starting point of university homework.__
