## K-Puzzle solver

K-Puzzle solver implemented in python using BFS, Best First Search and A* search algorithms. <br>
Heuristics used are Hamming and Manhattan. <br>
You can clone this repository, create a new project and after installing dependencies in requirements.txt run it in terminal with command:
* ##### python3 ./main k_value image_name.png algorithm Heuristic

Note that for Best First Search you have to type with no spaces and for A* you should type in AStar

#### I've only implemented search algorithms and heuristics, rest of the code was given to me as a starting point of university homework.
